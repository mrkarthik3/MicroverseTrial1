            Tyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial 
            behavior inside and outside the ring. Nicknamed "Iron" and "Kid Dynamite" in his early career, 
            and later known as "The Baddest Man on the Planet", Tyson is considered one of the best 
            heavyweights of all time.
