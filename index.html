            Tyson was known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial 
            behavior inside and outside the ring. Nicknamed "Iron" and "Kid Dynamite" in his early career, 
            and later known as "The Baddest Man on the Planet", Tyson is considered one of the best 
            heavyweights of all time.

        <p class="textcl">Early Life

            Michael Gerard Tyson was born on June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, to parents Jimmy Kirkpatrick 
            and Lorna Tyson. When Michael was two years old his father abandoned the family, leaving Lorna to care 
            for Michael and his two siblings, Rodney and Denise. Struggling financially, the Tyson family moved to 
            Brownsville, Brooklyn, a neighborhood known for its high crime. Small and shy, Tyson was often the target
            of bullying. To combat this, he began developing his own style of street fighting, which ultimately 
            transitioned into criminal activity. His gang, known as the Jolly Stompers, assigned him to clean out 
            cash registers while older members held victims at gunpoint. He was only 11 years old at the time.

            He frequently ran into trouble with police over his petty criminal activities, 
            and by the age of 13, he had been arrested more than 30 times. Tyson's bad behavior 
            landed him in the Tryon School for Boys, a reform school in upstate New York. At Tryon, 
            Tyson met counselor Bob Stewart, who had been an amateur boxing champion. Tyson wanted 
            Stewart to teach him how to use his fists. Stewart reluctantly agreed, on the condition 
            that Tyson would stay out of trouble and work harder in school. Previously classified as 
            learning disabled, Tyson managed to raise his reading abilities to the seventh-grade level 
            in a matter of months. He also became determined to learn everything he could about boxing,
             often slipping out of bed after curfew to practice punches in the dark.
